## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a classic machine learning problem where we use regression techniques to estimate the prices based on input features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc. In this project, we use the Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in the repository. It consists of two main files:
- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing features and target prices for training the model.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset containing features for which predictions need to be made.

Additionally, the repository includes:
- `House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data_description.txt`: Description of the features and their meanings in the dataset.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file format for Kaggle competitions or similar scenarios.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the required packages, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohMujeeb/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open and run the `House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression.ipynb` notebook to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file containing an overview of the project.
- `data_description.txt`: Description of the features and their meanings in the dataset.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file format for Kaggle competitions or similar scenarios.
- `train.csv`: The training dataset.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset.

## Results

The results of the house price predictions will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. You will see metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
